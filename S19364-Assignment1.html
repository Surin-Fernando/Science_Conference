            <p id="p_page2">Science is an "empirical" field, that is, it develops a body of knowledge<br><br>
                 by observing things and performing experiments. The meticulous process of gathering<br><br>
                 and analyzing data is called the "scientific method," and we sometimes use science to<br><br>
                 describe the knowledge we already have. Science is also what's involved in the performance<br><br>
                 of something complicated: "the science of making a perfect souffl√©."<br><br>
